Overview
This project is an AI-driven, blockchain-based bug bounty platform that enables secure, transparent, and private vulnerability reporting using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). It integrates smart contracts, AI-powered bug ranking, DAO governance, and automated bounty payments to revolutionize cybersecurity in the Web3 ecosystem.
Key Features
> Decentralized Bug Reporting – Researchers submit bugs without revealing full details using ZKPs.
> AI-Powered Bug Ranking – Machine learning models classify and prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity.
>Automated Bounty Payments – Smart contracts release payments instantly upon successful bug verification.
> DAO Governance for Dispute Resolution – Community-driven decision-making for handling disputes.
> Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for Privacy – Secure vulnerability disclosure without exposing sensitive data.
> Seamless Integration with Web3 & Smart Contracts – Supports Ethereum, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible chains.
> Secure, Trustless, and Transparent – Eliminates the need for centralized bug bounty platforms.
Tech Stack
•	Blockchain: Solidity, Hardhat, Ethereum, Polygon
•	AI/ML: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
•	ZKP Frameworks: zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Circom
•	Smart Contracts: ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 for bounty rewards
•	Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Web3.js
•	Backend: Node.js, Express, IPFS for decentralized storage
How It Works
1️ Security researcher submits a bug report using ZKPs.
2️ AI engine ranks the bug based on severity and impact.
3️ Smart contract verifies and processes the bug submission.
4️ DAO governance resolves disputes if necessary.
5️ Bounty is automatically distributed to the researcher upon approval.

Why This Matters?
Traditional bug bounty platforms are centralized, exposing security risks, high fees, and trust issues. Our platform leverages decentralization, AI, and cryptographic proofs to create a secure, efficient, and fair ecosystem for ethical hackers and organizations.
